# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation library. This directory contains comprehensive guides for running projects at OctoAcme, from initiation through retrospective and continuous improvement.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme operates a structured, customer-first project delivery methodology built on five core lifecycle phases: **Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective**. The process emphasizes iterative delivery of small, testable increments with clear ownership and data-informed decision-making. Each project is guided by a **Project Manager (PM)** who coordinates delivery and schedules, working in tandem with a **Product Manager (PdM)** who defines outcomes and prioritizes work. This dual-leadership model, combined with a commitment to psychological safety and learning, enables cross-functional teams—including Developers, QA/Testing professionals, and Stakeholders—to collaborate effectively from kickoff through retrospective.

The project lifecycle begins with lightweight validation during **Initiation**, where a Project One-pager captures the business need, success metrics, and initial timeline. Once approved, teams move into detailed **Planning**, breaking work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done. **Execution** follows a daily standup rhythm and twice-weekly team syncs, with progress tracked via project boards using pull request workflows, automated testing, and security scanning. OctoAcme emphasizes quality assurance through unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests, and manual QA validation when needed, all gated by CI/CD pipelines before **Release**.

**Risk management and transparent communication** are woven throughout the entire process. A Risk Register identifies, assesses, and monitors risks—with owners responsible for mitigation plans and escalation paths defined from team level through to sponsor level. Weekly status updates and stakeholder briefings keep stakeholders informed, while incident communication templates ensure swift and blameless response to production issues. Monthly stakeholder reviews and ad-hoc escalations maintain alignment and reduce surprises.

Finally, OctoAcme closes each project with a structured **Retrospective**, capturing learnings in three categories: what went well, areas for improvement, and actionable items. These action items feed back into the project backlog with clear owners and due dates, creating a continuous improvement cycle. This holistic approach—combining clear roles, defined workflows, rigorous quality practices, and a learning-oriented culture—enables OctoAcme teams to deliver valuable products reliably while maintaining alignment across the organization.
